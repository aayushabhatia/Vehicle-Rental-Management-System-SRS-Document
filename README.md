# Vehicle-Rental-Management-System-SRS-Document

#Problem Statement
The purpose of the assignment is to develop a requirements analysis document for a car rental management system. The manual car rental system was fraught with difficulties, including database management, which was a manual process. The goal is to develop a system that keeps detailed records of both the cars and the customers, the duration they rent the car, as well as the type of car they rent. The system will be mainly designed for a small company that renders car rental services to customers. The system will have the ability to generate and print invoices for each successful transaction.
The VRMS aims to streamline and modernize the entire rental process, from vehicle availability and booking to vehicle return and billing. This system will not only improve the agency's operational efficiency but also enhance the customer experience by providing a user-friendly online platform. Key issues that the VRMS seeks to address include:
1.	Inefficient Reservation Process: The current process for making vehicle reservations is cumbersome, involving paper forms and manual record-keeping. This leads to errors and delays in confirming reservations.
2.	Limited Vehicle Visibility: Customers struggle to access real-time information about vehicle availability, types, and pricing. This lack of transparency leads to customer frustration and lost business opportunities.
3.	Inaccurate Billing: The manual billing process often results in errors, overcharges, or undercharges. This not only affects revenue but also damages the agency's reputation.
4.	Manual Inventory Management: Managing a large fleet of vehicles manually is prone to errors, making it difficult to track vehicle maintenance, service schedules, and retirements.
5.	Customer Engagement: Customer interactions and feedback collection are inefficient, making it challenging to address customer concerns and improve services.
